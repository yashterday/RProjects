This Dataset is for a Heart Disease Predicter Model based on the following Kaggle DataSet:
 [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/downloads/heart-disease-uci.zip/1)
 
# Overview
---
This Classifier Model uses training set based on a randomly selected 70% of values from the data set and predicts the value of new data which in this case was the remaining 30% of data which was used to check the accuracy of the model. Although there was a relatively high error rate of ~ 20%, this project definitely was a strong stepping stone in creating more accurate models with larger data sets.
