This Dataset is for a Heart Disease Predicter Model based on the following Kaggle DataSet:
  https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/downloads/heart-disease-uci.zip/1

The following Attributes were used:
1.Age (in years)
2.Sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3.cp
  chest pain type:
    Value 1: typical angina
    Value 2: atypical angina
    Value 3: non-anginal pain
    Value 4: asymptomatic

4.trestbps
  resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5.chol
  serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6.fbs
  (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

7.restecg
  resting electrocardiographic results
  Value 0: normal
  Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
  Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

8.thalach
  maximum heart rate achieved

9.exang
  exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10.oldpeak
  ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11.slope
  the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  Value 1: upsloping
  Value 2: flat
  Value 3: downsloping

12. ca
  number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13.thal
  3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

14.target
  diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
  Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
  Value 1: > 50% diameter narrowing (in any major vessel)
